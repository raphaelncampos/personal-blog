Hello, folks!

Although not previously announced, I set a personal target in starting a blog until my bithday (cleverly, here I am the day before). My purpose is to share my views and experiences as a software engineer, game developer and as a human being in general.

I hope the experience will benefict all of us!

As to fill my fist article, I want to share the proccess to achieve this publication! As I entered the course [Welcome to the Django](http://welcometothedjango.com.br), I got in touch with so many good people! Within a discution topic, they where talking about personal blogs and encouraging people to do so. As it was my intention to do mine, so I started to analyse the cases and knew *Pelican*, a Python static site generator compatible with [Github pages](http://pages.github.com). The first time I thought about a blog, I was planning to use wordpress, and perceiving that I could do it as simple as a git-based text file project, it blew my mind!

#Pelican


It does not use a database, it compiles markdown files (in my personal case) to a static blog.

#Github Pages


Use a free Git repository to host your page.

I'm still getting familiar with the tools, but the important thing right now is to publish something and get out of inertia. =)
